    <p>For my whole life, my family has had all sorts of animals.</p>
    <p>We are by no means a farm, there are no cows or pigs.</p>
    <p>The animals we have are more for "Entertainment"</p>
    <p>Right now we have 5 horses, 4 goats, 4 chickens, 2 dogs, </p> 
    <p>a cat, and lastly a duck.</p>
    <p>They are all fun to watch and play with.</p>
    <p>Their only negitives are when we have to go and feed them all.</p>
