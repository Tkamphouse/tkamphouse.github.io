    <p>During the covid quarantine, I took up road biking so I could do</p>
    <p>something to get me out of the house. I would bike all around Sumas</p>
    <p>eventually to the point where I had biked every road in the town,</p>
    <p>which isn't that hard, it is a tiny town. One day I was so tired of</p>
    <p>biking the same old roads I through my bike over the border and started biking there.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, I didn't get away with it.</p>
    <p>More recently I have gotten into mountain biking. It's definitely a lot</p>
    <p>more intense than road biking, but nothing beats the adrenaline and being</p>
    <p>surrounded by nature while hurling down a mountain.</p>
