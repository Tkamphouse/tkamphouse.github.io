    <p>I picked up my first record at target, only because I liked the cover art. </p>
    <p>I diplayed it on my wall and after a few weeks I got another to go next to it.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I had collected about 10, when I thought I should probably have</p>
    <p>a record player so I could actually listen to them.</p>
    <p>This was all over a year ago, and today I have over 30 vinyl records,</p>
    <p>and a little corner in my room with a turn table and speakers to listen to them.</p>
    <p>One of my favoite things to do is stop in at a record store and see what gems I can find.</p>
