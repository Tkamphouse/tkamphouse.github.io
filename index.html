<p>Hello I'm Tyler :) </p>
<p>I have lived in Sumas Washington my whole life with my two siblings and parents.</p>
<p>We have horses, dogs, goats, and a cat named Skips.</p>
<p>My Dad, brother, and I frequently mountain bike at Gailbraith mountain in bellingham, </p>
<p>though they are much better than I am.</p>
<p>Some of my other hobbies are watching Formula 1, gaming, and collecting and listening to vinyl records.</p>
<p>I only started collecting them about a year and a half ago, </p>
<p>but I love displaying the art and puting one on and relaxing to it.</p>
